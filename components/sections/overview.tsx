      likelyLand: "Drive the next expansion through a governed, high-control workflow (likely regulatory reporting or risk analytics) where auditability and lineage are required — establish Snowflake as the control plane before expanding further.",
      expansionPath: "Expand from that initial workload into adjacent reporting, data sharing across entities, and AI-adjacent decision workflows where trust and governance are more critical than experimentation speed.",
      pressure: "Snowflake may be present but not fully platformized. If Databricks is entrenched in ML or engineering workflows, expansion should start in governed analytics and data sharing — win the control narrative, then expand outward.",
      personas: "CDO, Head of Data Engineering, Risk/Compliance leadership, Analytics leadership",
      hypothesis: "The constraint here is unlikely to be capability — it’s alignment. Expansion depends on connecting governance, ownership, and budget across teams that are currently operating independently.",
